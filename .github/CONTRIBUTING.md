# Contributing

If you are looking to contribute to the d3plus.org examples and documentation, please visit the [d3plus-storybook](https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-storybook.git) repository. If you are looking to contribute to the core source code of d3plus, start by cloning this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-text.git
```

## Setting up your Environment

1. Install Node Package Manager (NPM).
> <sub>If on a Mac, we suggest using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install packages on your machine. Once that's installed, you can install node (which includes npm) by running: `brew install node`</sub>
2. Install all repository dependencies:
```sh
npm i
```

And that's it! Your environment should be all set up and ready to start coding.

## Writing Code

All code is transpiled using [babel](https://babeljs.io/), which allows usage of most of the good bits from ES6. If you are unfamiliar with ES6, then normal vanilla javascript works fine as well (but we may suggest PR revisions to include more succinct ES6). All source code lives in the `./src` directory.

## Code Style

Every d3plus module adheres to the same `.eslintrc` ruleset for javascript syntax. This helps user contribution, as it guarantees a cohesive and easy to read code style throughout every module. The easiest way to follow the style guide is by installing a linter directly in your text editor, so that errors will be highlighted as you type. If your Pull Request does not match the project's linting style, it will not be merged.

## Running the Development Server

To test your code live in a browser, with auto-compiling and hot reloading, type this into your shell:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:4000/dev/` in your preferred browser to test your code live. Please store all test pages in the hidden `./dev` directory so that they do not get pushed to the repository. Here is a boilerplate HTML file to get your started:

```html
<script src="../build/d3plus-text.full.js"></script>
<body>

</body>
<script>

</script>
```
The development server detects any time a source file is modified, and will rebuild the browser javascript package and reload any open browser connections when a change occurs.

## Code Documentation

All of the Documentation you see in the README file is generated auto-magically from the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) formatted comments within each source file. This removes the nuisance of having to write documentation after the fact, and enforces strict code commenting. To regenerate the documentation at any time, simply run:

```sh
npm run docs
```

> This command is run automatically during the release process.

## Tests

Any time you write a new feature for a module, you should also be writing tests. D3plus modules come bundled with a test suite that let's you write functional tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).

All tests need to be placed in the `./test` directory, and the filenames should match up to the components in `./src` with a suffix of `-test.js`. To run all tests, run:

```sh
npm test
```
> This command will also lint all files using eslint.

Here is an example of what a test file could look like:

```js
import assert from "assert";
import it from "./jsdom.js"; // optional import, only the test needs window/document

it("example test title", () => {

  assert.strictEqual(true, true, "the truth test");

});

```
